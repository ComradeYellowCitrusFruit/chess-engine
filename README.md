# A simple Chess Engine library written in Rust

Title says it all.
I felt bored, wanted to get better at Rust, decided to write a chess engine.
I intend for it only to support classic Chess, and exclusively use rust.

It has a simple outward facing API that can verify the legality of a chess move, generate the next chess move, and check if a side is in checkmate at a specific moment.
